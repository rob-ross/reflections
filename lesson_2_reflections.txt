Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: It creates the .git folder in the directory. This keeps track of what files are being managed, their checkin and modification histories, etc.

You need to do it in order to use the rest of the git commands in your repository


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a interim area that allows you to add files into before you commit them. This offers an extra level of indirections, i.e., a “hook” that can be utilized to give more flexibility to the file’s lifecycle.
